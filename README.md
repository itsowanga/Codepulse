# CodePulse

CodePulse is a lightweight, offline-first C++ desktop app that monitors active coding time in any editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.), logs language usage, project folders, and focus streaks, and generates a daily/weekly productivity dashboard with charts — all without internet. Syncs to web only when connected.
